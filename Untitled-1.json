            "text": "To upload an image to an Amazon S3 bucket using Python, you'll need to install the `boto3` library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Here's an example code:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError\n\n# Replace these with your own values\nACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your_access_key_id'\nACCESS_SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_access_key'\nBUCKET_NAME = 'your_bucket_name'\nFILE_NAME = 'path/to/your/image/file.jpg'\n\n# Create an S3 client\ns3 = boto3.client('s3', aws_access_key_id=ACCESS_KEY_ID, aws_secret_access_key=ACCESS_SECRET_KEY)\n\ntry:\n    # Upload the image file to S3\n    s3.upload_file(FILE_NAME, BUCKET_NAME, FILE_NAME)\n    print(f'Image {FILE_NAME} uploaded successfully to {BUCKET_NAME} bucket.')\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(f'The file {FILE_NAME} was not found.')\nexcept NoCredentialsError:\n    print('Credentials not available.')\n```\n\nHere's what the code does:\n\n1. Import the required libraries: `boto3` for interacting with AWS services, and `botocore.exceptions.NoCredentialsError` for handling credential-related exceptions.\n2. Set your AWS credentials (`ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `ACCESS_SECRET_KEY`), the name of the S3 bucket you want to upload to (`BUCKET_NAME`), and the file path of the image you want to upload (`FILE_NAME`).\n3. Create an S3 client using `boto3.client('s3')` and pass your AWS credentials.\n4. Use the `s3.upload_file()` method to upload the image file to the specified S3 bucket. This method takes three arguments: the local file path (`FILE_NAME`), the bucket name (`BUCKET_NAME`), and the name you want to give the file in the S3 bucket (here, we use the same name as the local file).\n5. Handle exceptions: `FileNotFoundError` if the specified file is not found, and `NoCredentialsError` if AWS credentials are not available.\n\nMake sure to replace `'your_access_key_id'`, `'your_secret_access_key'`, `'your_bucket_name'`, and `'path/to/your/image/file.jpg'` with your actual AWS credentials, bucket name, and file path, respectively.\n\nNote: Before running this code, you'll need to install the `boto3` library by running `pip install boto3` in your terminal or command prompt."
