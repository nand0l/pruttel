## Slide 1: Agenda

- Serverless Computing Overview
- Serverless Computing on AWS
- AWS Lambda: Introduction and Working
- API Gateway: Features and Benefits
- AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)

Notes:
This slide sets the agenda for the module, covering key topics like serverless computing, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and AWS SAM. Each topic will be explored in detail, offering insights into serverless computing concepts, AWS services, and their applications.

## Slide 2: Serverless Computing Overview

- Understanding serverless computing
  - What is serverless computing
  - Benefits of serverless computing
  - Use cases of serverless computing

Notes:
Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. Benefits include reduced operational complexities, cost savings, and scalability. Common use cases range from web applications to data processing and IoT backends. More information can be found at [AWS Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/).

## Slide 3: Serverless Computing on AWS

- Serverless computing on AWS
  - Storage
  - NoSql database
  - Compute

Notes:
AWS offers a comprehensive suite of serverless computing services, including storage solutions like Amazon S3, NoSQL databases like Amazon DynamoDB, and compute services like AWS Lambda. These services enable scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solutions. Learn more at [AWS Serverless Computing Services](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/).

## Slide 4: AWS Lambda: Introduction and Working

- AWS Lambda
- Introduction to Lambda
- How AWS Lambda works

Notes:
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It scales automatically and charges for the compute time consumed. Lambda functions can respond to various event types and are integrated with a wide range of AWS services. Detailed information is available at [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

## Slide 5: API Gateway: Features and Benefits

- API Gateway
- Key Features of API Gateway
- Benefits of API Gateway

Notes:
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST and WebSocket APIs. It offers features like routing, data transformation, and security controls. Benefits include efficient API development, cost savings, and easy monitoring. For more details, visit [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/).

## Slide 6: AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)

- Serverless application model (SAM)
- What is AWS SAM?
- Key Features of AWS SAM

Notes:
AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) is a framework for building serverless applications on AWS. It extends AWS CloudFormation to provide a simplified way of defining the Amazon API Gateway APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and other AWS resources. More about SAM can be found at [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/).

## Slide 7: Recap

- Serverless Computing Overview
- Serverless Computing on AWS
- AWS Lambda: Introduction and Working
- API Gateway: Features and Benefits
- AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)

Notes:
This slide recaps the key topics covered in this module, summarizing the essentials of serverless computing, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and AWS SAM. This comprehensive overview provides a solid foundation in understanding serverless computing in AWS.
