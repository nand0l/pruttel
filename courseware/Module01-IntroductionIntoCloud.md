## Slide 5: Cloud providers Global Infrastructure

- Regions
- Availability Zones
- Edge Locations

_Notes:
The terms "Regions," "Availability Zones," and "Edge Locations" are commonly used by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to describe the architecture of its global infrastructure. However, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) use similar but not always identical terminology to describe their global infrastructure components. Here's how these concepts compare across AWS, Azure, and GCP:

### AWS
- **Regions:** Geographical areas that consist of two or more Availability Zones.
- **Availability Zones:** Distinct locations within a region that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones and provide inexpensive, low-latency network connectivity to other zones in the same region.
- **Edge Locations:** Sites deployed in major cities and areas around the world that are part of the AWS Content Delivery Network (CDN), Amazon CloudFront. They are used to cache copies of content for faster delivery to users at any location.

### Azure
- **Regions:** Geographically, this concept is similar to AWS. Azure also uses the term "region" to describe its data centers' geographic locations.
- **Availability Zones:** Azure's Availability Zones are high-availability offerings that protect applications and data from datacenter failures. They are physically separate locations within an Azure region.
- **Edge Zone:** Azure uses terms like "Azure Edge Zones" and "Azure Front Door" for its edge and networking services. Azure Edge Zones are local extensions of Azure, deployed directly within cities or areas to support real-time low-latency services. Azure's equivalent for a broader CDN might use Azure CDN or Azure Front Door, focusing on content delivery and edge computing services.

### GCP
- **Regions:** Like AWS and Azure, GCP uses "regions" to refer to specific geographical locations around the world that host its data centers.
- **Zones:** In GCP, what AWS calls "Availability Zones" are referred to simply as "Zones." These are deployment areas for cloud resources within regions, designed to offer isolation from failures in other zones.
- **Edge Locations:** Google Cloud uses the term "Points of Presence" (PoPs) for its global network of edge locations, which are part of Google's CDN (Cloud CDN) for delivering content closer to users.

In summary, while the concepts of regions and zones/availability zones are quite similar across AWS, Azure, and GCP, the terminology for edge locations varies more significantly. AWS uses "Edge Locations," Azure has "Edge Zones" and related services for edge and content delivery, and GCP refers to its network of edge caching servers as "Points of Presence" (PoPs).
