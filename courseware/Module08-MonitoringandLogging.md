## Slide 1: Introduction to Monitoring and Logging

- CloudWatch: Monitoring AWS resources and applications
- Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusting resources
- Elastic Load Balancing: Managing load balancers
- Trusted Advisor: Implementing best practices and cost optimization

_Notes:
Monitoring and logging are critical for maintaining the health and performance of AWS resources and applications. AWS CloudWatch provides comprehensive monitoring, while Auto Scaling ensures optimal resource utilization. Elastic Load Balancing distributes incoming application traffic, and Trusted Advisor offers insights for best practices and cost optimization. Understanding these services is key to effective cloud management. For an overview, visit [AWS Monitoring and Logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/logging-monitoring-for-application-owners/aws-services-logging-monitoring.html)._

## Slide 2: AWS CloudTrail

- Records user activity and API usage
- Store, Monitor, Analyze
- Every API-call is collected
- Audit, Security Monitoring, Operational Troubleshooting

_Notes:
AWS CloudTrail is a service that records user activity and API usage across AWS services. It allows for storing, monitoring, and analyzing API calls to support security, audit, and operational troubleshooting. CloudTrail is essential for compliance and governance, providing visibility into user and resource activity. For more information on CloudTrail, visit [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/)._

## Slide 3: Amazon CloudWatch

- Complete Visibility into cloud resources and applications
- Collect, Monitor, Act, Analyze
- Amazon CloudWatch use cases

_Notes:
Amazon CloudWatch offers complete visibility into AWS cloud resources and applications. It enables you to collect and monitor data, set alarms, and automatically react to changes in your AWS resources. CloudWatch supports various use cases, including application performance monitoring, root cause analysis, resource optimization, and impact testing. For detailed insights, visit [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)._

## Slide 4: Amazon CloudWatch Logs

- Log class, events, streams, groups
- Metric filters
- Retention Settings

_Notes:
Amazon CloudWatch Logs enables you to collect, store, and analyze log files from AWS resources. It organizes logs into classes, events, streams, and groups for easy management. Metric filters can be used to extract valuable insights from log data, and retention settings ensure logs are stored as per compliance needs.

## Slide 5: VPC Flow Logs

- Capture IP traffic information in VPC
- Publish to CloudWatch Logs and Amazon S3
- Retrieve and view data

_Notes:
VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. This data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Amazon S3 for analysis and retrieval. Flow logs are crucial for network monitoring, troubleshooting, and ensuring network security. For more information, visit [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html)._

## Slide 6: AWS X-Ray

- Analyze and debug modern applications
- Collect and record traces
- View service map
- Analyze issues

_Notes:
AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application and shows a map of your applicationâ€™s underlying components. For more on AWS X-Ray, visit [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/)._
