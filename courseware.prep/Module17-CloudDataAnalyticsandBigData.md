## Slide 2: Big Data: A Brief Overview

- Big Data: A Brief Overview
  1. Definition
  2. Challenges

Notes:
'Big Data' refers to extremely large data sets that traditional data processing tools cannot handle effectively. It encompasses three key dimensions: Volume (the massive amount of data), Velocity (the high speed of data generation and movement), and Variety (different types of data). The main challenges in handling big data include data capture, storage, analysis, sharing, visualization, and ensuring privacy.
