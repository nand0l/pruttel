## Slide 6: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery on AWS

- Software Release Workflows
- Build and Test Code
- Deployment Automation
- Unified CI/CD Projects

_Notes:
AWS's CI/CD capabilities simplify software release workflows, enabling teams to build, test, and deploy code quickly and reliably. AWS services support automation of these phases, allowing for a unified approach to CI/CD projects. More on this at [AWS CI/CD](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/)._

## Slide 7: Microservices

- Production Docker Platform
- Serverless Computing

_Notes:
Microservices architecture is an integral part of DevOps. AWS offers a Production Docker Platform for container management and Serverless Computing options, allowing for efficient microservices deployment and management. Further reading at [AWS Microservices](https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/)._

## Slide 8: Infrastructure as Code

- Templated Infrastructure Provisioning
- Chef Configuration
- Configuration Management
- Policy as Code

_Notes:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is critical for automating the provisioning and management of infrastructure. AWS facilitates this through templated provisioning, Chef for configuration management, and policy as code strategies. Deepen your understanding at [AWS Infrastructure as Code](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/infrastructure-as-code/)._

## Slide 9: Monitoring and Logging

- Cloud and Network Monitoring
- Distributed Tracing
- Activity & API Usage Tracking
- Application Availability

_Notes:
Effective Monitoring and Logging are essential for maintaining the performance and health of applications in the cloud. AWS offers tools for cloud and network monitoring, distributed tracing, API usage tracking, and ensuring application availability. Learn more at [AWS Monitoring and Logging](https://aws.amazon.com/products/monitoring/)._

## Slide 10: Platform as a Service

- Run and Manage Web Apps

_Notes:
AWS's Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions provide a streamlined environment to run and manage web applications, reducing the complexity of infrastructure management. Discover AWS PaaS solutions at [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)._

## Slide 11: Version Control

- Private Git Hosting

_Notes:
Version control is pivotal in DevOps for tracking and managing changes to software code. AWS offers solutions for private Git hosting, facilitating version control in a secure and efficient manner. For more, visit [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/)._
