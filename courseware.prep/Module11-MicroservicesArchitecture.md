# Module11 - MicroservicesArchitecture



## Slide 1: Agenda

- Microservices Architecture
- Containerization
- Container Management with AWS
- Microservices Design Patterns

Notes:
This slide introduces the agenda for our session, focusing on Microservices Architecture. We'll cover the principles, advantages, and challenges of microservices, delve into containerization and its management in AWS, and explore microservices design patterns. This comprehensive overview will provide insights into deploying and managing microservices architectures effectively.

## Slide 2: Microservices Architecture

- Microservices
  - Principles of microservices architecture
  - Advantages of microservices architecture
  - Challenges of microservices architecture

Notes:
Microservices architecture is a method of developing software systems that focuses on building single-function modules with well-defined interfaces and operations. The key principles include decentralized data management, automated deployment, and a focus on specific business capabilities. Advantages include scalability, flexibility, and the ability to use different technologies for different services. However, challenges such as increased complexity in deployment and communication between services are notable. More information can be found at [AWS Microservices Architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/).

## Slide 3: Containerization

- Containerization
  - What is Containerization
  - What are containers
  - How are containers managed/orchestrated

Notes:
Containerization involves encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a container that can run on any computing environment. Containers are lightweight, standalone packages that contain everything needed to run the software, including the code, runtime, system tools, and libraries. Containers are managed and orchestrated through systems like Kubernetes, which handle the lifecycle, scaling, and deployment of containers. For more information, visit [AWS Containerization](https://aws.amazon.com/containers/).

## Slide 4: Container Management with AWS

- Container Management with AWS
  - ECS (Elastic Container Service)
  - EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
  - ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

Notes:
AWS provides various services for container management. ECS is a highly scalable, high-performance container management service that supports Docker containers. EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane. ECR is a Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. Detailed insights can be found at [AWS Container Services](https://aws.amazon.com/products/containers/).

## Slide 5: Microservices Design Patterns

- Microservices design patterns

Notes:
Microservices design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in software architecture within a microservices system. These patterns address various issues like service discovery, configuration management, and circuit breaking. Understanding these patterns helps in creating robust and scalable microservices architectures. Further reading is available at [AWS Microservices Design Patterns](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/microservices/).

## Slide 6: Recap

- Microservices Architecture
- Containerization
- Container Management with AWS
- Microservices Design Patterns

Notes:
In this module, we've covered the fundamentals of Microservices Architecture, including its principles, advantages, and challenges. We've also explored containerization, its orchestration, and container management services provided by AWS, such as ECS, EKS, and ECR. Additionally, we discussed various microservices design patterns. These topics provide a comprehensive understanding of implementing and managing microservices architectures in AWS.
