# Module07 - CloudDatabases



## Slide 1: Introduction to Cloud Databases

- 8 different database types
- RDS (Relational Database Service)
- Amazon Aurora
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Caching databases
- Other Database tools

_Notes:
AWS Cloud Databases offer a wide range of database services to cater to different needs, including relational, NoSQL, and caching databases, as well as use case specific databases like Document, Ledger, and Graph databases. This module will cover the key aspects of AWS's database offerings, including RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB, caching databases like ElastiCache and DAX, and other database tools like DMS and SCT. Understanding these services is crucial for effectively managing and utilizing databases in the cloud. For an overview, visit [AWS Database Services](https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/)._

## Slide 2: AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB
- Microsoft SQL
- Oracle
- Aurora

_Notes:
AWS RDS simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. RDS supports several database engines including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL, Oracle, and Aurora, offering flexibility and choice for database management. For more details on RDS, visit [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)._

## Slide 3: Amazon Aurora

- Built for the cloud
- Built in the cloud
- Full MySQL and PostgreSQL compatibility
- Cost effective

_Notes:
Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud. It combines the performance and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. Aurora is up to three times faster than standard MySQL databases and provides the security, availability, and reliability of commercial databases at 1/10th the cost. Learn more about Aurora at [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/)._

## Slide 4: Amazon DynamoDB

- NoSQL database service
- Serverless
- Millisecond response time
- Global availability is optional

_Notes:
Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. It is a fully managed, serverless database that supports both document and key-value store models. DynamoDB is designed for global availability and durability, making it ideal for mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and many other applications. For more on DynamoDB, visit [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)._

## Slide 5: Caching Databases

- ElastiCache: In-memory caching service
- DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

_Notes:
Caching databases in AWS, such as ElastiCache and DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), provide in-memory caching services to enhance the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases. ElastiCache supports Redis and Memcached, while DAX is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for DynamoDB. For more information, visit [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) and [DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/dax/)._

## Slide 6: Other Database Tools

- Database Migration Service (DMS)
- AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)

_Notes:
AWS offers tools to facilitate database migration and conversion. The Database Migration Service (DMS) helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. The AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) makes heterogeneous database migrations easy by automatically converting the source database schema and a majority of the database code objects to a format compatible with the target database. These tools simplify the migration process and minimize downtime. For more on these tools, visit [AWS Database Migration Services](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/) and [AWS Schema Conversion Tool](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/schema-conversion-tool/)._
