# Module05 - ComputeinCloud



## Slide 1: Introduction to Cloud Compute Services

- AWS compute services Categories
  - Instances (Virtual Machines)
  - Containers
  - Serverless
  - Edge and Hybrid

_Notes:
AWS Compute Services provide a range of computing solutions to meet various application requirements. This includes Instances for virtual machines, Containers for microservices-based architectures, Serverless computing for event-driven applications, and Edge and Hybrid solutions for decentralized computing needs. Understanding these categories is crucial for selecting the right compute resources for different workloads. For an overview, visit [AWS Compute Services](https://aws.amazon.com/products/compute/)._

## Slide 2: Cost and Capacity Management

- Cost and Capacity management

_Notes:
Effective cost and capacity management is key to optimizing AWS compute resources. AWS offers tools and services to help users manage and scale their resources efficiently, ensuring they get the best performance at the lowest possible cost. This involves understanding and selecting the right instance types, leveraging autoscaling, and monitoring usage to avoid unnecessary expenses. For more on managing costs and capacity, visit [AWS Cost Management](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/)._

## Slide 3: EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
  - Instances
  - AMI
  - Autoscaling

_Notes:
Amazon EC2 provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing users to launch virtual servers as instances. EC2 offers a wide range of instance types for different use cases. Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) provide pre-configured templates for instance creation. Autoscaling ensures that the number of instances scales up or down automatically, according to defined conditions, to handle changes in demand. For detailed information on EC2, visit [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)._

## Slide 4: Container Services

- Container Services
  - Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
  - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

_Notes:
AWS Container Services, including Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS, offer powerful tools to manage and scale containerized applications. Amazon ECS is a highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers. Amazon EKS is a managed service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane. For more on AWS container services, visit [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) and [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)._

## Slide 5: Serverless Computing

- Serverless
  - Lambda: Basics of serverless computing

_Notes:
Serverless computing with AWS Lambda allows users to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda automatically scales the application by running code in response to events. It's ideal for applications that require backend services without server management. This model can significantly reduce operational complexity and cost. For more on AWS Lambda and serverless computing, visit [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)._

## Slide 6: Understanding Your Workload Characteristics

- Understanding Your Workload Characteristics
  - Type of Workload
  - Stateless or Stateful
  - Traffic Patterns

_Notes:
Understanding workload characteristics is essential for selecting the appropriate AWS compute services. This includes identifying whether the workload is stateless or stateful, understanding the type of workload (e.g., web application, batch processing), and recognizing traffic patterns (e.g., consistent, sporadic, or unpredictable). This knowledge helps in choosing the right compute solutions and optimizing resource utilization. For guidance on assessing workload characteristics, visit [AWS Workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.question.PERF_2.en.html)._

## Slide 7: Recap and Conclusion

- Recap of AWS Compute Services
- Emphasizing the Importance of Right Compute Resource Selection
- Encouraging Exploration of AWS Compute Solutions

_Notes:
This final slide recaps the key aspects of AWS Compute Services, emphasizing the importance of selecting the right compute resources for different types of workloads. Understanding these services is vital for anyone looking to leverage AWS for their computing needs.
