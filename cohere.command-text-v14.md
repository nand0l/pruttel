 Here is an example of Python code that uses the Boto3 library to upload an image to an Amazon S3 bucket:
```python
import boto3
import botocore

# Create an S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# Define the image file to be uploaded
image_file = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'  # Replace with the actual path to your image file

# Specify the bucket name and key (optional) where you want to upload the image
bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'  # Replace with your S3 bucket name
key = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'  # Specify the path in the bucket where you want to store the image

# Check if the file exists
if not botocore.exceptions.FileNotFoundError(os.path.exists(image_file)):
    try:
        # Start the upload
        response = s3.upload_file(image_file, bucket_name, key)

        # Print the upload ID if it's a multipart upload
        if 'UploadId' in response:
            print('Multipart upload initiated. Upload ID: ', response['UploadId'])
        else:
            print('File uploaded to s3://{}/{}'.format(bucket_name, key))
    except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as e:
        print('Error uploading file:', e)
else:
    print('Image file not found.')
```

Before running this code:
1. Install the `boto3` library if you haven't already by running `pip install boto3`.
2. Replace `'your-bucket-name'` with the actual name of your Amazon S3 bucket.
3. Replace `'path/to/your/image.jpg'` with the path to your local image file that you want to upload to the S3 bucket.
4. If you want to specify a different key (path) within the S3 bucket to store the image, replace `'path/to/your/image.jpg'` with your desired key.

This code will upload the image file to the specified S3 bucket using the Boto3 library. Make sure that the person running the code has the correct permissions to perform the upload and access the S3 bucket.
