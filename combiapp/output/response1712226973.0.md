It offers low-latency, high-performance storage for databases, file systems, and applications that require direct access to storage blocks. Examples include Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), Azure Managed Disks, and Google Persistent Disk.

**Shared File Storage**: Also known as file storage or file system storage, this category provides a fully managed file system that can be accessed and shared across multiple compute instances or applications. It is suitable for workloads that require shared access to files, such as content management systems, media processing, and web serving. Examples include Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), Azure Files, and Google Cloud Filestore.

**Object Storage**: Object storage is designed for storing and retrieving large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, videos, backups, and log files. Data is stored as objects with unique identifiers and metadata, making it highly scalable and cost-effective for data lakes, archiving, and static website hosting. Examples include Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage._

## Slide 3: Data Migration in Cloud

* Online Data Transfer
* Offline Data Transfer

_Notes:  
Migrating data to the cloud can be accomplished through online or offline transfer methods:

**Online Data Transfer**: Online data transfer involves transferring data over the internet using cloud provider tools or third-party solutions. This method is suitable for smaller datasets or scenarios where network bandwidth is not a concern. Examples include AWS DataSync, Azure Data Box, and Google Cloud Transfer Service.

**Offline Data Transfer**: For large datasets or scenarios with limited network bandwidth, offline data transfer is often preferred. This involves physically shipping storage devices (e.g., hard drives or tapes) containing the data to the cloud provider's data center. The cloud provider then uploads the data to the desired storage service. Examples include AWS Snowball, Azure Data Box, and Google Cloud Transfer Appliance.

Both online and offline transfer methods often employ techniques such as compression, deduplication, and parallel transfers to optimize data transfer and reduce bandwidth usage or physical shipment costs._

## Slide 4: Hybrid Cloud Storage and Edge Computing

* Hybrid Cloud Storage
* Edge Computing

_Notes:  
**Hybrid Cloud Storage**: Hybrid cloud storage solutions combine on-premises storage with cloud storage, allowing organizations to keep sensitive or regulated data on-premises while leveraging the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the cloud for other data. This approach enables data mobility between environments and provides a unified management experience. Examples include AWS Storage Gateway, Azure StorSimple, and Google Cloud Hybrid Cloud.

**Edge Computing**: Edge computing involves processing data closer to its source, at the network's edge, rather than sending all data to a centralized cloud or data center. This minimizes latency and reduces bandwidth usage by processing and filtering data locally before sending it to the cloud. Edge computing is often used in scenarios such as IoT, real-time analytics, and content delivery networks (CDNs). Examples include AWS Outposts, Azure Stack Edge, and Google Cloud IoT Edge._

## Slide 5: Managed File Transfer in Cloud

* Cloud Transfer Family

_Notes:  
Cloud providers offer managed file transfer services to facilitate secure and efficient data transfers between different environments, such as on-premises systems, cloud storage, and third-party services. These services typically provide features like encryption, monitoring, scheduling, and compliance support.

**Cloud Transfer Family**: This category includes services like AWS Transfer Family (AWS Transfer for SFTP, AWS Transfer for FTP, and AWS Transfer for FTPS), Azure File Transfer, and Google Cloud Transfer Service. These services enable secure file transfers using protocols like SFTP, FTP, and FTPS, allowing organizations to move data between on-premises systems, cloud storage, and other cloud services._
