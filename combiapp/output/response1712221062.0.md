# Module 03 - IAM (Identity and Access Management)

## Slide 1: Introduction to IAM

- Overview of IAM
- Importance in Cloud Security
- Key Components: Users, Groups, Roles

_Notes:  
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a crucial component of cloud security, providing tools to manage access to cloud services and resources securely. IAM allows you to create and manage users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to cloud resources. Understanding IAM is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of your cloud environment.

In AWS, you can refer to [AWS IAM Overview](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) for more information.
In Azure, you can refer to [Azure Identity Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) for more information.
In GCP, you can refer to [Cloud Identity](https://cloud.google.com/identity) for more information._

## Slide 2: Users, Groups, and Roles

- **Users**: Individual identities for person or service
- **Groups**: Collections of users
- **Roles**: Delegating permissions without sharing credentials

_Notes:
In IAM, **Users** are individual entities that represent a person or service that can interact with the cloud platform. **Groups** are collections of users, which simplify permission management. **Roles** are used to delegate permissions to cloud services or users from other accounts. Understanding these components is vital for effective IAM management.

For a detailed guide in AWS, visit [Getting Started with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started.html).
For Azure, refer to [Azure Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis).
For GCP, refer to [Cloud Identity](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/concepts/overview) and [IAM Roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles)._

## Slide 3: Policies and Permissions

- **Policies**: Documents defining allowed or denied actions
- **Permissions**: Specific capabilities assigned to users, groups, or roles

_Notes:
**Policies** in IAM are documents that define what actions and resources the user, group, or role can access. **Permissions** determine the level of access a user, group, or role has in the cloud platform. Policies are attached to these IAM identities to grant the required permissions.

For more on policies and permissions in AWS, see [IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html).
For Azure, refer to [Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview) and [Role-based Access Control (RBAC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview).
For GCP, refer to [Cloud IAM Policies](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/policies) and [Understanding Roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles)._

## Slide 4: Best Practices in IAM

- Least Privilege Principle
- Regularly Rotate Credentials
- Use Roles for Compute Instances
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

_Notes:
Adhering to best practices in IAM enhances security. The **Least Privilege Principle** involves granting only the permissions necessary to perform a task. **Regularly Rotating Credentials** and using **Roles for Compute Instances** reduce risks. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** adds an additional security layer.

For best practices in AWS, visit [IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html).
For Azure, refer to [Azure Identity Management Best Practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/identity-management-best-practices).
For GCP, refer to [Best Practices for IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices)._

## Slide 5: IAM Features

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Identity Federation

_Notes:
IAM's key features include **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**, which requires additional authentication information, and **Identity Federation**, allowing users to authenticate with external identity providers. These features enhance the security and flexibility of access management in the cloud.

For more on IAM features in AWS, visit [IAM Features](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/).
For Azure, refer to [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks) and [Azure AD Identity Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity).
For GCP, refer to [Cloud Identity Multi-Factor Authentication](https://cloud.google.com/identity/mfa) and [Identity Federation](https://cloud.google.com/identity/solutions/cloud-identity-federation)._
